# Content Style Guide (Joyful Mind)

## Non-negotiables
- Meditation is a **trainable skill**, not a personality trait.
- Awareness is **already present**.
- Thoughts/emotions are **not enemies**.
- Familiarity over force.
- No religious terms, rituals, or authority tone.

## Language rules
Prefer:
- “notice”, “allow”, “see if you can”, “it’s okay”, “you can stop anytime”
Avoid:
- “empty your mind”, “clear thoughts”, “transcend”, “enlightenment”, “raise vibration”

## Required reassurance pattern per session
Include at least once:
- Normalizing mind wandering
- Noticing = the win
- A grounding exit option

## Safety microcopy
Always allowed:
- Eyes open
- Switching anchors
- Stopping

## Prompts (reflection)
- What did you notice?
- What felt easy?
- What felt difficult, and how did you relate to it?

No “success” metrics.
